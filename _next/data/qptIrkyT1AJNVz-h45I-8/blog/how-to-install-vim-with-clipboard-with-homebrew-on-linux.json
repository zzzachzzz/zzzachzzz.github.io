In my experience, working with Windows Subsystem for Linux specifically, a simple `brew install vim` didn't cut it, and `vim --version` displayed that sad `-clipboard`. I would prefer to use the same package manager between OSX and Linux, especially since I use a shell script for installing all my brew packages. In the past I've just resorted to installing vim-gtk to get a clipboard enabled build of vim on Linux. However, vim-gtk only yielded me version 8.0, while brew offered 8.2. I cared enough about this to open a GitHub issue and get a solution.\n\n[Installing custom formula for Vim, options not present (+clipboard) - GitHub Issue](https://github.com/Homebrew/linuxbrew-core/issues/19505)\n\n**TL;DR How to install Vim with +clipboard on Linux**\n\n1.  Install dependencies  \n    `sudo apt-get install libncurses5-dev libgnome2-dev libgnomeui-dev libgtk2.0-dev libatk1.0-dev libbonoboui2-dev libcairo2-dev libx11-dev libxpm-dev libxt-dev`\n2.  Modify the vim formula  \n    `brew edit vim`  \n    Change the configure option `--without-x` to `--with-x` and add the option `--with-features=huge`. Save the changes.\n3.  ```bash\n    system \"./configure\", \"--prefix=#{HOMEBREW_PREFIX}\",\n                          \"--mandir=#{man}\",\n                          \"--enable-multibyte\",\n                          # New options\n                          \"--with-x\",\n                          \"--with-features=huge\",\n    ```\n4.  Install the modified formula  \n    `brew install --build-from-source vim`\n\nIt is crucial to have the necessary dependencies installed. I tried these steps with the same formula options, `--with-x` and `--with-features=huge`, and my Vim installation _silently failed to include clipboard support, prior to installing the dependencies_. This is a major nuisance, and I hope to have raised some awareness of this issue, for a use case as common as installing Vim with clipboard support with Homebrew on Linux.\n","slug":"how-to-install-vim-with-clipboard-with-homebrew-on-linux"}},"__N_SSG":true}

I cannot believe that this feature is not advertised more on <a href="https://github.com/NeoVintageous/NeoVintageous" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="A__A_-sc-14fqd0c-0 oXjRv">Neovintageous&#x27;s GitHub</a> readme.

For the record, I&#x27;m not allergic to Vim. I use it every day for quick file edits, but it doesn&#x27;t have the allure that Sublime does on me. When you discover the power of a .vimrc, you may become addicted to making it your own, and improving upon some of Vim&#x27;s less desirable default key mappings.</p><p>I don&#x27;t have a ton of modifications, but I&#x27;ll share what I do have, as well as my motive behind each remap. If you want more, you can look on GitHub at some of the Vim customization repos with thousands of stars, and hundreds of lines of modifications. I prefer to keep it a little bit simpler. By the way, the file goes in your Sublime User folder with your other customizations. Example path on a Windows machine: <code class="Code-sc-1amjnp4-0 fRlBcp">C:\Users\&lt;your user&gt;\AppData\Roaming\Sublime Text 3\Packages\User\.neovintageousrc</code></p><p>Just before I get into the <code class="Code-sc-1amjnp4-0 fRlBcp">.neovintageousrc</code>, I know of one keybinding that needs to be assigned in the regular Sublime keybinding settings, and it&#x27;s the most important one:</p><pre class="TreeToJSX__Pre-sc-1taxolb-0 cTrNrc language-javascript" tabindex="0"><code class="language-javascript"><span class="token punctuation">{</span>

This is a popular one. <code class="Code-sc-1amjnp4-0 fRlBcp">jk</code> is another good alternative. Onto the rest of the key mappings...</p><h2 id="neovintageousrc"><code class="Code-sc-1amjnp4-0 fRlBcp">.neovintageousrc</code></h2><p><code class="Code-sc-1amjnp4-0 fRlBcp">noremap J 5j</code> Shift + j moves the cursor down 5 lines<br/><code class="Code-sc-1amjnp4-0 fRlBcp">noremap K 5k</code> Shift + k moves the cursor up 5 lines<br/><code class="Code-sc-1amjnp4-0 fRlBcp">noremap W 5w</code> Shift + w moves the cursor forward 5 words<br/><code class="Code-sc-1amjnp4-0 fRlBcp">noremap B 5b</code> Shift + b moves the cursor backwards 5 words</p><p>These 4 navigation mappings just make sense to me, <code class="Code-sc-1amjnp4-0 fRlBcp">J</code> and <code class="Code-sc-1amjnp4-0 fRlBcp">K</code> in particular. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d seen these elsewhere. I don&#x27;t like counting lines and words every time I wanna move around in Vim, so instead I would end up spamming <code class="Code-sc-1amjnp4-0 fRlBcp">j</code> and <code class="Code-sc-1amjnp4-0 fRlBcp">k</code>. I think this strikes a good balance for medium distance movement, without the need to first hit an arbitrary number key, and then my intended movement command. This way, I can just hold shift and fly around.</p><p><code class="Code-sc-1amjnp4-0 fRlBcp">noremap M J</code> Join lines with M</p><p>Ah but wait! I just replaced another very important default keybinding for joining lines with J. Yes, so I opted for a key next to it, M, which by default moves your cursor to the middle of the screen. This could also be a useful one, but I didn&#x27;t find myself using it. Customize as you wish.</p><p><code class="Code-sc-1amjnp4-0 fRlBcp">noremap 0 ^</code><br/><code class="Code-sc-1amjnp4-0 fRlBcp">noremap ^ 0</code></p><p>Here I&#x27;m swapping the keys responsible for moving the cursor to the beginning of the line, and moving the cursor to the first non-whitespace character (skip the indentation). The latter I find far more useful, so I made it the key that&#x27;s easier to press, <code class="Code-sc-1amjnp4-0 fRlBcp">0</code>.</p><p><code class="Code-sc-1amjnp4-0 fRlBcp">noremap $ g_</code></p><p><code class="Code-sc-1amjnp4-0 fRlBcp">$</code> moves the cursor to the end of the line and includes the newline character. So if you yank and paste that, you&#x27;ll get an extra line. <code class="Code-sc-1amjnp4-0 fRlBcp">g_</code> is one of those random vim bindings under the g &#x27;namespace&#x27;, and it moves the cursor to the end of the line, excluding the newline character. Much better.</p><p><code class="Code-sc-1amjnp4-0 fRlBcp">noremap m `
noremap ` m</code></p><p>Here, I&#x27;m swapping the key for creating a mark and going to a mark. I go to marks far more often than I create them, so it makes sense to me to make goto mark easier to press with <code class="Code-sc-1amjnp4-0 fRlBcp">m</code>.</p><p><code class="Code-sc-1amjnp4-0 fRlBcp">noremap &lt;lt&gt; ,</code> Translates to <code class="Code-sc-1amjnp4-0 fRlBcp">noremap &lt; ,</code> but <code class="Code-sc-1amjnp4-0 fRlBcp">&lt;</code> is a special character in the vimrc syntax<br/><code class="Code-sc-1amjnp4-0 fRlBcp">noremap , ;</code></p><p>Normally when using <code class="Code-sc-1amjnp4-0 fRlBcp">f</code> or <code class="Code-sc-1amjnp4-0 fRlBcp">t</code> to find a character in a line, you would use <code class="Code-sc-1amjnp4-0 fRlBcp">;</code> to jump to the next result, and <code class="Code-sc-1amjnp4-0 fRlBcp">,</code> to jump to the previous result. What I&#x27;ve done here, is sort of mimic the logic of <code class="Code-sc-1amjnp4-0 fRlBcp">n</code> and <code class="Code-sc-1amjnp4-0 fRlBcp">N</code> for going to the next and previous result in a Vim search. You&#x27;re using the same key, but holding <code class="Code-sc-1amjnp4-0 fRlBcp">Shift</code> to do the reverse. This pattern is seen all throughout default Vim keybindings. With <code class="Code-sc-1amjnp4-0 fRlBcp">,</code> and <code class="Code-sc-1amjnp4-0 fRlBcp">&lt;</code>, the mapping becomes much the same. You can think of it as <code class="Code-sc-1amjnp4-0 fRlBcp">,</code> to jump to the next result, and <code class="Code-sc-1amjnp4-0 fRlBcp">Shift + ,</code> to jump to the previous result.</p><p><code class="Code-sc-1amjnp4-0 fRlBcp">noremap &lt;C-s&gt; :w&lt;CR&gt;</code></p><p>Make the default keybind for saving in Vim also supported in Sublime.</p><p><code class="Code-sc-1amjnp4-0 fRlBcp">vnoremap &lt;Tab&gt; &gt;gv
vnoremap &lt;S-Tab&gt; &lt;gv</code></p><p>I don&#x27;t know all the technicalities of this one, but what it allows is for the repeated indentation and reverse indentation of a selection in visual mode, using <code class="Code-sc-1amjnp4-0 fRlBcp">Tab</code> and <code class="Code-sc-1amjnp4-0 fRlBcp">Shift + Tab</code>.</p><p>That&#x27;s all I&#x27;ve got!

For the record, I'm not allergic to Vim. I use it every day for quick file edits, but it doesn't have the allure that Sublime does on me. When you discover the power of a .vimrc, you may become addicted to making it your own, and improving upon some of Vim's less desirable default key mappings.\n\nI don't have a ton of modifications, but I'll share what I do have, as well as my motive behind each remap. If you want more, you can look on GitHub at some of the Vim customization repos with thousands of stars, and hundreds of lines of modifications. I prefer to keep it a little bit simpler. By the way, the file goes in your Sublime User folder with your other customizations. Example path on a Windows machine: `C:\\Users\\\u003cyour user\u003e\\AppData\\Roaming\\Sublime Text 3\\Packages\\User\\.neovintageousrc`\n\nJust before I get into the `.neovintageousrc`, I know of one keybinding that needs to be assigned in the regular Sublime keybinding settings, and it's the most important one:\n\n```javascript\n{\n    \"keys\": [\"j\", \"j\"],\n    \"command\": \"_enter_normal_mode\",\n    \"args\": {\"mode\": \"mode_insert\"},\n    \"context\": [{\"key\": \"vi_insert_mode_aware\"}]\n},\n```\n\n`jj` for exiting insert mode, instead of having to reach over to press `\u003cEsc\u003e`. This is a popular one. `jk` is another good alternative. Onto the rest of the key mappings...  \n\n\n## `.neovintageousrc`\n\n`noremap J 5j` Shift + j moves the cursor down 5 lines  \n`noremap K 5k` Shift + k moves the cursor up 5 lines  \n`noremap W 5w` Shift + w moves the cursor forward 5 words  \n`noremap B 5b` Shift + b moves the cursor backwards 5 words\n\nThese 4 navigation mappings just make sense to me, `J` and `K` in particular. I don't think I'd seen these elsewhere. I don't like counting lines and words every time I wanna move around in Vim, so instead I would end up spamming `j` and `k`. I think this strikes a good balance for medium distance movement, without the need to first hit an arbitrary number key, and then my intended movement command. This way, I can just hold shift and fly around.  \n  \n  \n`noremap M J` Join lines with M\n\nAh but wait! I just replaced another very important default keybinding for joining lines with J. Yes, so I opted for a key next to it, M, which by default moves your cursor to the middle of the screen. This could also be a useful one, but I didn't find myself using it. Customize as you wish.  \n  \n  \n`noremap 0 ^`  \n`noremap ^ 0`\n\nHere I'm swapping the keys responsible for moving the cursor to the beginning of the line, and moving the cursor to the first non-whitespace character (skip the indentation). The latter I find far more useful, so I made it the key that's easier to press, `0`.  \n  \n  \n`noremap $ g_`\n\n`$` moves the cursor to the end of the line and includes the newline character. So if you yank and paste that, you'll get an extra line. `g_` is one of those random vim bindings under the g 'namespace', and it moves the cursor to the end of the line, excluding the newline character. Much better.  \n  \n  \n``noremap m `\nnoremap ` m``\n\nHere, I'm swapping the key for creating a mark and going to a mark. I go to marks far more often than I create them, so it makes sense to me to make goto mark easier to press with `m`.  \n  \n  \n`noremap \u003clt\u003e ,` Translates to `noremap \u003c ,` but `\u003c` is a special character in the vimrc syntax  \n`noremap , ;`\n\nNormally when using `f` or `t` to find a character in a line, you would use `;` to jump to the next result, and `,` to jump to the previous result. What I've done here, is sort of mimic the logic of `n` and `N` for going to the next and previous result in a Vim search. You're using the same key, but holding `Shift` to do the reverse. This pattern is seen all throughout default Vim keybindings. With `,` and `\u003c`, the mapping becomes much the same. You can think of it as `,` to jump to the next result, and `Shift + ,` to jump to the previous result.  \n  \n  \n`noremap \u003cC-s\u003e :w\u003cCR\u003e`\n\nMake the default keybind for saving in Vim also supported in Sublime.  \n  \n  \n`vnoremap \u003cTab\u003e \u003egv\nvnoremap \u003cS-Tab\u003e \u003cgv`\n\nI don't know all the technicalities of this one, but what it allows is for the repeated indentation and reverse indentation of a selection in visual mode, using `Tab` and `Shift + Tab`.\n\nThat's all I've got!

What I've done here, is sort of mimic the logic of `n` and `N` for going to the next and previous result in a Vim search. You're using the same key, but holding `Shift` to do the reverse. This pattern is seen all throughout default Vim keybindings. With `,` and `\u003c`, the mapping becomes much the same. You can think of it as `,` to jump to the next result, and `Shift + ,` to jump to the previous result.  \n  \n  \n`noremap \u003cC-s\u003e :w\u003cCR\u003e`\n\nMake the default keybind for saving in Vim also supported in Sublime.  \n  \n  \n`vnoremap \u003cTab\u003e \u003egv\nvnoremap \u003cS-Tab\u003e \u003cgv`\n\nI don't know all the technicalities of this one, but what it allows is for the repeated indentation and reverse indentation of a selection in visual mode, using `Tab` and `Shift + Tab`.\n\nThat's all I've got! Have fun customizing to make it your own ~\n","slug":"a-practical-guide-to-learning-vim"}},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/blog/[slug]","query":{"slug":"a-practical-guide-to-learning-vim"},"buildId":"RLlUhHA7KG-LZd7bnK2IS","nextExport":false,"isFallback":false,"gsp":true}</script><script nomodule="" src="/_next/static/chunks/polyfills-28654a8145d7603786fc.js"></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/main-c746a4ce4ff8692382cd.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/webpack-50bee04d1dc61f8adf5b.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/framework.37f4a736348214b3ca94.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/commons.e810983d220ce60d77fa.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/d31217defe14a45f21f2dc88a0340a4400241e5c.43128fe35357df1292f1.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/pages/_app-c5083ace283475b900f0.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/f55490c27d84c973f151130575d86126183b0b6b.3b39966ad3ab6ba53dac.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/14e8b4443f853547963f3fff4f6d87edb6a6aabe.40db631bc2cb4cd6b167.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/pages/blog/%5Bslug%5D-3e90714ce7440c4a9cbd.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/RLlUhHA7KG-LZd7bnK2IS/_buildManifest.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/RLlUhHA7KG-LZd7bnK2IS/_ssgManifest.js" async=""></script></body></html>

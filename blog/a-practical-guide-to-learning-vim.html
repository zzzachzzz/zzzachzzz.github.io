What I've done here, is sort of mimic the logic of `n` and `N` for going to the next and previous result in a Vim search. You're using the same key, but holding `Shift` to do the reverse. This pattern is seen all throughout default Vim keybindings. With `,` and `\u003c`, the mapping becomes much the same. You can think of it as `,` to jump to the next result, and `Shift + ,` to jump to the previous result.  \n  \n  \n`noremap \u003cC-s\u003e :w\u003cCR\u003e`\n\nMake the default keybind for saving in Vim also supported in Sublime.  \n  \n  \n`vnoremap \u003cTab\u003e \u003egv\nvnoremap \u003cS-Tab\u003e \u003cgv`\n\nI don't know all the technicalities of this one, but what it allows is for the repeated indentation and reverse indentation of a selection in visual mode, using `Tab` and `Shift + Tab`.\n\nThat's all I've got! Have fun customizing to make it your own ~\n","slug":"a-practical-guide-to-learning-vim"}},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/blog/[slug]","query":{"slug":"a-practical-guide-to-learning-vim"},"buildId":"RJhSgEuEM-DTGw2xptl7C","isFallback":false,"gsp":true,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
